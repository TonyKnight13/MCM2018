### 2.1 Data Screening

The amount of data is large, so the first thing is to filter the data based on its completeness
and validity.

First, we screen the data of 30,000 historical business data provided by the lender:

- Since tag attributes are crucial and can not be completed, we delete all business data that did not indicate a value.
- In the analysis of the attributes, we found that there are a large number of missing
attributes of AGENT and salary level in the data, in which the salary level can be complemented because it is a numerical attribute with continuous meaning. For AGENT, because it is text type data and we did not find it related to other attributes,so we choose to delete AGENT this attribute.
- The proportion of default and non-default data is unbalanced. Considering that many training models require sample balance, certain strategies need to be adopted to balance the data. We find the data's ratio is about 1:25, so we use both the undersampling and oversampling at the same time.

### 2.2 Data merging

- In data processing, we find that there are four  values repeated for the education level variables. The variable has repeated values which contain junior college degree and blow, junior college degree, senior high school degree and junior high school degree. Also there are repeated values which are graduate, doctoral and masterâ€™s degree and more than three kinds of classification. So, we combine the former into one class and the latter into the other.
